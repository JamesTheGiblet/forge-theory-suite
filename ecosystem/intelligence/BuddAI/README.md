## What BuddAI Can Do, and Why It Matters

BuddAI started as a simple idea: a local tool that remembers the corrections you teach it and applies those patterns to future code. No cloud training, no hype — just a system that improves the more you use it.

### What it can do today

- **Think with you:** Uses the v5.0 Personality Engine to understand intent ("thinking about a robot") without rigid commands.
- **Remember context:** Manages multiple projects with persistent memory, recalling exactly where you left off.
- **Generate code:** 90% accuracy on ESP32, validated over 14 hours of testing.
- **Learn patterns:** Stores your corrections permanently and reuses them automatically.
- **Validate output:** Applies 8 hardware-specific validators to catch common mistakes.
- **Run locally:** 100% local execution with no data leaving your machine.

### Where it's heading

- Support for multiple boards (ESP32 family, Arduino, STM32, Pico)
- Hundreds to thousands of learned patterns from real use
- Expanded validators for protocols, sensors, safety, and domain-specific rules
- Higher accuracy across more hardware as the pattern library grows
- A system that becomes faster and more reliable the longer you work with it

### Why this matters

Most AI tools don't learn from you. They reset every session, forget your corrections, and generate generic output. BuddAI does the opposite — it keeps everything you teach it and builds on that knowledge over time.

The more you use it, the more it reflects your own approach, your hardware experience, and your problem-solving patterns. That compounding effect is where the real value comes from.

## Quick Start (10 Minutes)

### 1. Install Ollama

```bash
# Download from https://ollama.com
# One-click installer
```

### 2. Pull the Model

```bash
ollama serve  # Keep running in background

# In new terminal:
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b    # ~2GB download
```

### 3. Get BuddAI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/BuddAI
cd BuddAI
```

### 4. Run It

```bash
# Terminal mode
python buddai_executive.py

# Or web interface (recommended)
python buddai_server.py --server
# Open http://localhost:8000/web
```

### 5. First Build

```txt
You: thinking about a spinner robot

BuddAI: Ah nice! Full-body spinner? 
        Reminds me of GilBot. New project or variant?

You: new one, 3kg class

BuddAI: Creating new project...
        [Interactive setup]
        What should we build first?
```

**That's it. You're running.**

## How It Actually Works

### The Learning Loop

### Example: Teaching BuddAI once saves forever

```txt
Step 1: Generate code
You: "Generate servo control"
BuddAI: Uses analogWrite(pin, value);  // ❌ Wrong for ESP32

Step 2: Correct it
You: /correct ESP32 uses ledcWrite, not analogWrite
BuddAI: ✅ Stored in database

Step 3: Every future generation
BuddAI: Uses ledcWrite(channel, value);  // ✅ Automatic
```

**That correction is permanent.** You taught it once. It applies forever.

---

### The Architecture (No Magic)

```txt
User Request
    ↓
Load recent corrections from SQLite
    ↓
Inject into prompt as context
    ↓
Call local LLM (Qwen 2.5 Coder)
    ↓
Validate with 8 hardware-specific validators
    ↓
Auto-fix common issues
    ↓
Return clean code
```

**Simple but effective:**

- Database stores your corrections
- Prompt engineering injects them as context
- Validators catch hardware-specific mistakes
- LLM generates code following YOUR patterns

### Time Savings (Measured)

**Traditional development:**

```txt
Research:  30 min
Code:      60 min
Debug:     60 min
Total:     150 min per module
```

**With BuddAI:**

```txt
Generate:  1 min
Review:    10 min
Fix:       10 min
Test:      30 min
Total:     51 min per module

SAVINGS: 99 minutes (66% faster)
```

**GilBot project:** 30 hours manual → 8.7 hours with BuddAI (71% savings)

## The 8 Validators

**What protects your code:**

1. **ESP32 Hardware** - Catches `analogWrite()`, wrong ADC resolution (4095 not 1023)
2. **Motor Control** - Prevents PWM conflicts, ensures L298N pins defined
3. **Timing Safety** - Requires safety timeouts, prevents `delay()` in motor loops
4. **Forge Theory** - Suggests exponential smoothing for fluid movement
5. **Servo/Combat** - Enforces state machines for weapon systems
6. **Arduino Compat** - Removes unnecessary includes, checks initialization
7. **Memory Safety** - Removes unused variables
8. **Style Guide** - Prevents feature bloat, enforces naming conventions

**29 checks total. Every generation protected.**

## Essential Commands

```bash
/correct <why>  # Teach BuddAI the right way
/learn          # Extract patterns from corrections
/good           # Mark response as correct
/rules          # Show all learned patterns
/validate       # Check generated code
/metrics        # Show accuracy stats
```

### How to Use the Learning Loop

```txt
1. Generate code
2. Review (usually 85-95% correct)
3. If wrong: /correct <explanation>
4. Run /learn to extract patterns
5. Next generation: automatically improved

Typical: 1-3 iterations to perfection
Your effort: 5-15 min teaching
Result: Permanent improvement
```

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Works NOW

- ESP32-C3 firmware (90% accuracy)
- Hardware-specific validation
- Persistent correction database
- Auto-fix for common errors
- 100% local execution
- Web + terminal interfaces
- Remote access (Tailscale/Ngrok)

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Domain-specific:** Best for embedded systems (trained on ESP32)
- **Requires training:** Fresh install starts at 60-70%, needs YOUR corrections
- **Model constraints:** 3B parameter model (fast but limited)
- **Session persistence:** Loads recent rules, not all patterns

**Future improvements:** Load all patterns on startup, fine-tune on YOUR corrections

**The paradox:**
By making the code completely open, YOUR version becomes completely unreplicatable.

The value isn't the code (free forever).  
The value is YOUR training data (6 months of corrections, 1,000+ patterns, YOUR methodologies).
